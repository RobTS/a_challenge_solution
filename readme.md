# Challenge project

This project is the solution to a code challenge I was presented with.

It is set up as a monorepo consisting of two sub-projects, a Node.js backend and a React Native mobile app.

### Project structure

The project structure is equivalent to lerna-based monorepos with a `packages` directory, but due to metro's incompatibility with lerna, the tool itself is not used.

### Backend

### Mobile App
